    <h3>Browser Testing </h3>
    <p>My site is tested and working on Google Chrome and Firefox. I did not test in IE because lol IE. My site is also fairly mobile friendly due to responsive design where <em>relative sizes(%)</em>  were used instead of <em>fixed sizes (px). </em></p>
    <h3>Alignment</h3>
    <p>The entire page is in a div called <em>container</em>. Placing the whole site in a container div makes it easier to align and manage the padding of the page</p>
    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <p>Navigation on the site is done through the menu bar. The bar is able to change colour when the mouse is over it due to the hover selector <em>a:hover</em> </p>
    <h3>CSS Summary</h3>
    <p>A single CSS stylesheet was used to style this website. CSS dictated how everything was positioned and how it appeared.</p>
    <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><span>CSS Selector</span></td>
    <td><em>Category</em></td>
    <td><em>How was this used?</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>#container</td>
    <td>ID</td>
    <td>Keeps the entire page in a container div, making setting margins more uniform.&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>#menu</td>
    <td>ID</td>
    <td>Allows the menu bar to be styled without affecting other elements</td>

    <td>Used to style the header bar separate from the menu bar</td>

    <td>Element</td>
    <td>These were styled within IDs, allowing them to be diffrent based on the div they were in</td>

<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
      <h3>Colour Scheme</h3>
      <p> The background of this website is a light pink colour, complementing the dark gray div elements. I like this colour as it is a fresh change from the plain white backgrounds, while not being as cluttered as an image background. For the text, white was used, providing contrast and nice readability even during the late hours of the night. </p>
      <h3> Fonts </h3>
      <p>The font I chose to use was <em>Open Sans</em>, a sans-serif font from Google Fonts. I like this font because it gives a more modern feel to the website. The font was made more aesthetic by changing the font weight and letter spacing for headings.</p>
    <h2>Accessiblity</h2>
<p>The website is also <em>suitable for people who suffer from colourblindness</em>. From using contrasting colours, text and other elements are easier to see. Additionally, text and other elements on this website are quite large, making them easier to read for the vision impaired.</p>
    <p>The website is <em>suitable for users lacking fine motor control</em> or any other disability that prevents the use of a mouse. The entire website can be accessed using the keyboard, using the <em>shift key</em> to select menu items and the <em>space key to scroll</em> </p>
    <p>The site is suitable for people with hearing disabilities as there is <em>no audio</em> on the site.
